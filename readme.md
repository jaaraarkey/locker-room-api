This is my version of Locker-room challenge.

I've managed to adapt a provided code in some way.
The challenges were I've faced are:
	-Implementating authentication;
 	-Deploying on Heroku.

The functionalities that are still missing are:
	-Admin mode;
 	-Deliting message;
  	-Editing message;
   	-Lobbiies funcrionality;
    	-Logout.
